<h1>FIFA World Cup 2014 News</h1>
<p>
    The biggest scoreline in the history of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers - and indeed in the history of
    international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.
    </p>
    <p>
    This legendary match also brought global renown for Archie Thompson, whose 13-goal haul set a new world
    record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.
    </p>
    <p>
    And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it
    is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, â€˜Next Goal Wins', showing across the world.
